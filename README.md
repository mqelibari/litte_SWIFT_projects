| Kata|  Description |
|------|-------------|
|[Bouncing Ball](https://github.com/mqelibari/litte_SWIFT_projects/blob/main/BouncingBall.swift)           |  A ball is thrown out of the window of floor X. When it bounces on the floor and bounces back to Y% of its previous height. How often does floor Z, which is below floor X, see the ball bounce past it?   |
|[Summerize](https://github.com/mqelibari/litte_SWIFT_projects/blob/main/Sumemerizer.swift )                | Sum all numbers up to the number x |
|[Diamond Maker](https://github.com/mqelibari/litte_SWIFT_projects/blob/main/diamondMaker.swift )         | Draw a diamond of the size of odd numbers|
|[Double Array Values](https://github.com/mqelibari/litte_SWIFT_projects/blob/main/doubleArrayValues.swift)  | Double all values in the array|
|[Double digits and Concatenate](https://github.com/mqelibari/litte_SWIFT_projects/blob/main/doubleDigitsAndConcatenate.swift) |Double the values of each digit and write the results side by side as a single number |
|[Num Reverser](https://github.com/mqelibari/litte_SWIFT_projects/blob/main/numReverser.swift) |Turn the given number around |
|[Num Counter](https://github.com/mqelibari/litte_SWIFT_projects/blob/main/one_counter.swift) |Raise the individual digits of a number to the power of itself and find out how often a certain number occurs in the individual results. |
|[String Reapeter](https://github.com/mqelibari/litte_SWIFT_projects/blob/main/stringRepeater.swift ) |Repeat a string x times |
|[Word Spinner](https://github.com/mqelibari/litte_SWIFT_projects/blob/main/wordSpinner.swift)|Turn over every word in the sentence that has length greater than or equal to 5 |
